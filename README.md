## 🎯 WHAT THIS DOES

✅ Scrapes / loads **Amazon Best Seller data**  
✅ Analyzes **trends, categories, prices, ratings**  
✅ Outputs **charts, graphs, or chaotic insights**  
✅ Answers critical questions like:
- “Why are 17,000 people buying a $3 phone stand?”
- “Is ‘dog water bottle with selfie mirror’ a real category?”
- “Who is buying 500-pack toilet paper in 2025???”

## 🧪 TECH STACK (AKA “WHAT BROKE AT 2AM”)

```python
import pandas as pd        # For pretending you know what you're doing
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # For making graphs that look ✨fancy✨
import seaborn as sns      # For when matplotlib says “nah, you do it”
import requests            # To politely ask Amazon for data (they say no)
import time                # To sleep between requests (so Amazon doesn’t ban you)
```

> 💡 *Optional: Add `selenium` if you’re feeling spicy (and ready to get blocked).*
