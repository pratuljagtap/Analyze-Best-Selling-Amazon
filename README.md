Analyze Best Selling Amazon Books with Pandas# Analyze Best Selling Amazon Books with Pandas

A data‐analysis project to explore and visualise trends in Amazon's bestselling books using Python and Pandas.

---

## Motivation

Why this project exists:  

- To understand what makes a book a bestseller on Amazon.  
- To practice working with real-world datasets using Pandas.  
- To generate insights—e.g. trends by genre, price range, author, review count, etc.

## Features

Here are some of the things this analysis does:

- Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, normalize formats)  
- Compute descriptive statistics (mean, median, distributions)  
- Visualize trends (sales, pricing, ratings over time)  
- Compare genres, authors, publication dates  
- Identify outliers (books that are unusually popular or highly rated)  
- Summary insights and possibly recommendations
